# Yoshi's Island Screen Exit Randomizer
Scrambles the screen exit data in all level object binaries

Requires the Yoshi's Island Disassembly: https://github.com/brunovalads/yoshisisland-disassembly

Place the script in the \level\ folder. The script will create a list from the existing level object binaries, so make sure you have a backup of the original files.
Run assemble.bat using asar in the parent folder.

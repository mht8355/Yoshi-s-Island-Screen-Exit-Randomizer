# Yoshi's Island Screen Exit Randomizer
Scrambles the screen exit data in all level object binaries

Requires the Yoshi's Island Disassembly: https://github.com/brunovalads/yoshisisland-disassembly

Place the script in the \level\ folder. The script will build a list of screen exit data from the existing level object binaries. As always, if you want to be safe, keep a backup of the original files.
To build a rom, run asar.exe targeting assemble.asm in the parent folder (\disassembly\).
